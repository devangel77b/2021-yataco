I am happy to recommend Jocelyne Yataco for your program. Jocelyne was a student in my department and was in two classes I taught in, EW200 (Introduction to Systems Engineering) and EW202 (Principles of Mechatronics). These two classes are taught to all Robotics and Controls Engineering majors during their 3/c (sophomore) year here at the Naval Academy and cover programming, engineering design, and embedded microcontrollers.  

I remember vividly interacting with Jocelyne when she came on several occasions for extra instruction. In EW200, she worked hard to learn objected-oriented programming principles applied to graphical user interfaces (GUI) in Matlab, even though the rudimentary ``video game'' project she was assigned only required very basic plotting commands. I also distinctly remember her keeping me on my toes at exam reviews for EW200 and EW202, where she would attend and ask very insightful questions about C programming, basic circuits, embedded microcontrollers, servos, and motors. 

Jocelyne was slated to be in my section for EW485 (Comparative Biomechanics) this year. I was very sad when I saw her name dropped from my class list, due to medical reasons that are requiring her to leave the Naval Academy. I wish I could work more with this outstanding student, and I know she will find great success in your program and wherever she goes next. 

%Maybe you could talk about the time I came for EI for my ES200 project where I was working on how to save data on GUI for my video game score menu. Iâ€™m asking letters from Capt Campbell, my leadership professor, and Ms. Julia Grim, the study abroad coordinator.
